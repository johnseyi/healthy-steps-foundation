## ORGANIZATIONAL APPROACH

### Philosophy
Healthy Steps Foundation takes a **holistic approach** to mental health wellness by addressing the **short-term and temporary insecurities** that affect overall wellbeing. Mental health cannot be separated from physical needs, economic stability, education, and spiritual health.

### Real Mission Statement (from client)
> *"Healthy Steps Foundation is a faith-based organization that seeks to partner with families to improve mental health wellness. Our holistic approach includes researching and introducing techniques and programs designed to treat individuals suffering with mental health challenges in a respectful and dignified manner."*

### Service Model
- **Faith-Based**: Rooted in spiritual principles — faith shapes how we serve
- **Partnership**: We work *with* families, not just *for* them
- **Dignified**: Respectful treatment of every individual — no shame in needing help
- **As-Needed Basis**: Emergency, crisis-response support — not long-term welfare
- **Holistic**: Addressing spiritual, mental, physical, and economic wellness together
- **Temporary Support**: Helping families through crisis periods toward self-sufficiency

### Program Limitations (enforce these in all content)
- **School Tuition**: Maximum **one semester** per family
- **Adult Vocation**: **One adult family member** per family
- **All Programs**: As-needed, emergency basis — not ongoing welfare

## TECHNOLOGY STACK (ACTUAL — do not change)

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Next.js | 16.2.3 | App Router, Turbopack |
| TypeScript | Strict mode | No `any` types |
| Tailwind CSS | v4 | CSS `@theme` block — no tailwind.config.js |
| Framer Motion | v12 | `type Variants`, `ease: 'easeOut' as const` |
| Lucide React | latest | Icons throughout |
| React Hook Form | latest | + Zod via `@hookform/resolvers/zod` |
| next/font | built-in | Inter (sans) + Merriweather (serif) |

### Critical Tailwind v4 Notes
- Config is in `src/app/globals.css` via `@theme { ... }` — **no tailwind.config.js**
- Custom colors use CSS variable naming: `--color-forest-green-900`, etc.
- Plugins: `@plugin "@tailwindcss/forms"` and `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"`

### Critical Framer Motion v12 Notes
- Always `import { type Variants } from 'framer-motion'` when defining variant objects
- Use `ease: 'easeOut' as const` (not plain string) to satisfy TypeScript
- `FadeUp` component (`src/components/ui/FadeUp.tsx`) is the standard scroll animation wrapper

### Netlify Deployment (confirmed real target — 2026-07-13)
- `netlify.toml` at root — `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` runs the Next.js runtime (SSR/SSG, image
  optimization, routing) on Netlify without a static export. Node 20.
- `[functions] directory = "netlify/functions"` — standalone functions (e.g.
  `recurring-reminders.ts`) live here alongside the functions the plugin generates for the app.
- `vercel.json` was removed (2026-07-13) — Netlify is the confirmed deploy target and keeping both
  configs invited drift. Do not re-add it without confirming Vercel is actually being used.

#### Data & Logic
- `src/lib/constants.ts` — all static data (PROGRAMS, STAFF_MEMBERS, TESTIMONIALS, IMPACT_STATS, SWIFT_DETAILS, ORG)
- `src/lib/validations.ts` — Zod `donationSchema` + `contactSchema`
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — `formatCurrency`, `calculateDonationTotals`, `cn`
- `src/types/index.ts` — all TypeScript interfaces (`Program.image` is required, not optional)

### ⏳ PENDING — Blocking launch
- [x] **SWIFT bank details** — dfcu Bank details filled into `SWIFT_DETAILS` (2026-07-13),
      including `swiftBicCode: 'DFCUUGKA'` (confirmed 2026-07-17).
- [x] **US check mailing address** — `US_CHECK_DETAILS.mailingAddress` filled in (2026-07-17):
      `3800 Wekiva Rd., Longwood, FL 32779`, sourced from the client's "Fund Raising News letter"
      (checks payable to First Baptist Sweetwater Church, HSF on the FOR line).
- [ ] **Real impact statistics** — fill into `IMPACT_STATS` in `src/lib/constants.ts`
- [x] **Real testimonials** — two real testimonials from the Makerere Kikoni outreach are live in
      `TESTIMONIALS` (2026-07-30): Charles Kasibante (medical partner) and Patricia Kayeny
      (beneficiary). The three placeholder testimonials (Grace N., John K., Sarah M.) were removed —
      they were invented. Never re-add fabricated testimonials.
- [ ] **Donation backend env vars** — see "DONATION SYSTEM (BACKEND)" section below; code is built
      but needs Supabase/Resend accounts + env vars before it can run end-to-end.
- [ ] **Testing + deployment** — final Netlify deploy and smoke test

## DESIGN SYSTEM — "Community Documentary"

All pages follow these six rules (stored in memory at `.claude/projects/.../memory/project-design-system.md`):

### Rule 1 — Amber is accent only
Amber (`amber-400`/`amber-500`) is used for: accent rules (`w-10 h-0.5 bg-amber-500`), CTA buttons, icon backgrounds on light. Never as a large section background.

### Rule 2 — Section heading pattern (apply everywhere)
```tsx
<div className="w-10 h-0.5 bg-amber-500 mb-4" />
<p className="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-widest text-warm-gray-400 mb-3">Label</p>
<h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold font-serif text-warm-gray-900">Heading</h2>
```
On dark (`bg-forest-green-900`): replace `text-warm-gray-400` with `text-forest-green-300`, use `bg-amber-400`.

### Rule 3 — Photo-anchored heroes (two variants)
**Full-bleed overlay** (most pages):
```tsx
<section className="relative min-h-[70vh] flex items-center overflow-hidden">
  <Image src={PHOTO} alt="..." fill className="object-cover object-center" priority sizes="100vw" />
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-forest-green-900/95 via-forest-green-900/70 to-forest-green-900/20" />
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-forest-green-900/55 via-transparent to-transparent" />
  <div className="relative z-10 container mx-auto px-6 py-28">...</div>
</section>
```
**Split-screen** (About, Mission): `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 min-h-[78vh]` — left panel `bg-forest-green-900`, right panel `next/image fill`.

### Rule 4 — Two background colours per page
Alternate between `bg-warm-white`, `bg-white`, `bg-forest-green-50`, and `bg-forest-green-900`. Never use `bg-amber-500` as a section background.

### Rule 5 — Stats use large forest-green serif numbers
```tsx
<div className="text-5xl sm:text-6xl font-black text-forest-green-600 font-serif mb-2">{value}</div>
```
Not white-on-amber. Stats sections use `bg-white` or `bg-warm-white`.

### Rule 6 — Program/content cards
Real photos at top (`aspect-[16/10]`, `object-cover`, hover scale). No icon-in-whitespace pattern.

---

## UI SYSTEM (premium pass — 2026-07-30)

A shared visual/interaction layer sits on top of the Community Documentary rules. **Use these
primitives instead of hand-rolling classes** — that is what keeps the site looking like one product.

### Tokens in `globals.css` `@theme`
| Token | Utility | Use for |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `--shadow-soft` | `shadow-soft` | Resting cards, form fields, small chips |
| `--shadow-lift` | `shadow-lift` | Hovered cards, the contact form |
| `--shadow-float` | `shadow-float` | Modals, drawers, floating captions, hero photos |
| `--shadow-glow-amber` / `--shadow-glow-green` | `shadow-glow-amber` | CTA hover glow only |
| `--ease-out-expo` etc. | `ease-[cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)]` | Every transition longer than 200ms |
| `--animate-float-slow`, `--animate-shimmer`, `--animate-marquee` | `animate-float-slow` … | Ambient motion |

Shadows are tinted with the warm ink colour, not black — do **not** go back to `shadow-md`/`shadow-xl`.

### Component classes (`@layer components`)
- `.grain-overlay` — film-grain wash for photo heroes. Needs `position: relative` on the element.
- `.link-sweep` — underline that draws in from the left on hover/focus.
- `.sheen` — light sweep across a button on hover (already baked into `Button`).

### Primitives — reach for these first
| Need | Use | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Button | `Button` from `ui/Button` | Variants: `primary` (amber gradient), `secondary`, `outline`, `ghost`, `onDark` |
| Button that navigates | `ButtonLink` | **Never** `<Link><Button>` — `<a>` wrapping `<button>` is invalid HTML and double-announces to screen readers |
| `tel:` / `mailto:` styled as a button | `buttonStyles(variant, size, className)` on a plain `<a>` | Must stay a real anchor, not a next/link route |
| Section heading | `SectionHeading` from `ui/SectionHeading` | Props: `eyebrow`, `title`, `lead`, `tone` (`light`/`dark`), `align` |
| Program icon | `programIcon(program.icon)` from `lib/icons` | Single source of truth — do not re-declare local icon maps |
| Form field chrome | `fieldClasses` / `fieldErrorClasses` from `ui/Input` | Shared by `Input`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` |

Buttons are **pill-shaped** (`rounded-full`) site-wide. Primary CTAs are dark text on amber, not
white on amber — white on amber-500 failed contrast.

### Header behaviour (`layout/Header.tsx`)
- Sticky; compresses (logo + padding shrink) and switches to frosted glass past 12px of scroll.
- Reading-progress bar along the bottom edge, driven by `useScroll`.
- `About` and `Programs` are Framer Motion dropdowns that open on hover **and** on click/focus, and
  close on Escape, outside blur, or route change. The old CSS `group-hover` version was unreachable
  by keyboard.
- Active route gets an amber underline via `usePathname`.
- ⚠️ The mobile drawer is a **sibling of `<header>`, not a child**. The header's `backdrop-filter`
  makes it a containing block for `position: fixed`, which would clip the drawer to the header's
  height. Do not move it back inside.

### Global UX
- Skip-to-content link in `(marketing)/layout.tsx`, targeting `#main-content`.
- `BackToTop` (`layout/BackToTop.tsx`) — appears after ~1 viewport, ring fills with scroll progress.
- Global `:focus-visible` ring, branded scrollbar, `::selection`, and a
  `prefers-reduced-motion` block that neutralises every animation and transition.

⚠️ **Fonts**: `--font-sans` / `--font-serif` in `@theme` MUST reference `var(--font-inter)` /
`var(--font-merriweather)` — the variables `next/font` sets in `layout.tsx`. They previously named
`'Inter'` / `'Merriweather'` literally, which silently fell back to system fonts because next/font
emits hashed family names.

## CONTENT THAT IS REAL (from client)

### Program Short Descriptions (all in constants.ts)
- **Food Closet**: "Emergency food support that meets immediate food insecurities for families in need."
- **Clothing Closet**: "Basic wardrobe essentials provided on an as-needed basis to maintain dignity and confidence."
- **Children Tuition**: "School tuition assistance to keep children in education, supporting up to one semester per family."
- **Adult Vocation**: "Vocational skills training for one adult family member in farming, tailoring, or mechanics."
- **Family Medical**: "Medical support on an as-needed basis to address health emergencies and basic healthcare needs."
- **Resource Materials**: "Spiritual, mental wellness, and vocational resource materials to support holistic family development."

### Core Values (real — used on About and Mission pages)
1. **Faith-Based** — Guided by spiritual principles
2. **Partnership** — Work alongside families, not for them
3. **Dignity & Respect** — Honour every individual
4. **Holistic Wellness** — Mental, physical, and spiritual health together
5. **Community** — Neighbours walking with neighbours
6. **Integrity** — Transparent with donors, partners, and families

## DONATION FLOW (CRITICAL FEATURE)

### Two Payment Methods
`/donate` (`DonatePageClient.tsx`) lets donors pick one of two manual (non-real-time) methods —
no payment is ever taken through this website itself:
1. **SWIFT bank transfer** (`DonationForm.tsx`) — international donors, dfcu Bank Uganda.
2. **US check giving** (`CheckDonationPanel.tsx`) — US donors mail a check to First Baptist
   Sweetwater (partner church), zero transfer fees.

Both forms submit to the same `POST /api/donations` endpoint (`method: 'swift' | 'us-check'`) —
see "DONATION SYSTEM (BACKEND)" below for what actually happens on submit.

### Donation Form Fields (`src/lib/validations.ts` → `donationSchema`)
- `method`: `'swift' | 'us-check'`
- `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone?`, `country`
- `type`: `'one-time' | 'recurring'`
- `recurringFrequency?`: `'monthly' | 'quarterly' | 'annually'`
- `amount`: quick buttons $25/$50/$100/$250/$500 or custom
- `fund`: one of 7 fund slugs (6 programs + `where-needed-most`)
- `coverBankFee`: boolean checkbox (SWIFT only — check giving has no fee, always `false`)
- `companyWebsite`: honeypot field, must stay empty (hidden input, bots that autofill trip it)
- Calculated server-side via `calculateDonationTotals` in `src/lib/utils.ts`: `donationAmount`,
  `bankFee` ($45), `totalAmount`

### SWIFT Bank Details (`src/lib/constants.ts` → `SWIFT_DETAILS`)
dfcu Bank, Kampala Road branch — filled in 2026-07-13, `swiftBicCode` confirmed 2026-07-17:
```typescript
export const SWIFT_DETAILS = {
  bankName: 'dfcu Bank',
  accountHolder: 'Healthy Steps Foundation',
  accountNumberUsd: '02660018653045',
  accountNumberUgx: '01660018653014',
  swiftBicCode: 'DFCUUGKA',
  branch: 'dfcu Kampala Road',
  branchAddress: '8H7H+HJ6, Kampala Road, Kampala',
};
```
`US_CHECK_DETAILS.mailingAddress` is filled in as `'3800 Wekiva Rd., Longwood, FL 32779'`
(First Baptist Sweetwater's address, sourced from the client's newsletter).

### Donation Popup
- Fires **5 seconds** after any page load
- Once per session (`sessionStorage` key: `hsf_popup_shown`)
- Quick donate $50 / $100 → routes to `/donate?amount=X&fund=where-needed-most&type=one-time`
- Backdrop click or X button closes

---

## DONATION SYSTEM (BACKEND) — built 2026-07-13

Submitting either donation form now does real work, not just a client-side modal:
1. `POST /api/donations` validates, computes totals, and inserts a row into Supabase (`donations`
   table — see `supabase/schema.sql`), which returns a generated `invoice_number`
   (`HSF-{year}-{6-digit sequence}`).
2. A PDF **pledge confirmation** (not a payment receipt — funds haven't arrived yet) is rendered
   with `@react-pdf/renderer` (`src/lib/pdf/donation-pledge.tsx`) and emailed to the donor via
   Resend (`src/lib/email.ts`), attached to the confirmation email.
3. Recurring donors get periodic reminder emails since SWIFT/check giving is manual — a Netlify
   Scheduled Function (`netlify/functions/recurring-reminders.ts`, daily at 06:00 UTC) calls
   `runDueRecurringReminders()` in `src/lib/reminders.ts`.
4. Staff can see all submitted pledges and mark them "received" at `/admin/donations`, gated by a
   single shared password (`src/middleware.ts` + `src/lib/admin-auth.ts`, signed session cookie,
   12h TTL).

### Required env vars (`.env.local` locally, Netlify dashboard for production)
`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (needs a
verified sending domain in Resend — a Gmail address won't work), `ADMIN_PASSWORD`,
`ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` (random 32+ byte secret, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`). None of these
accounts have been created yet — that's on the client/user, not something built here.

### Why `src/lib/reminders.ts` and `src/lib/donation-row.ts` avoid `@/*` and `server-only`
Netlify's function bundler doesn't resolve the `@/*` tsconfig path alias, and the `server-only`
package throws when imported outside Next's RSC bundling — so anything reachable from
`netlify/functions/recurring-reminders.ts` (via a relative import) has to be self-contained with
relative imports only and build its own Supabase/Resend clients rather than reusing
`src/lib/supabase.ts` / `src/lib/email.ts` (which ARE `server-only`-guarded, since those are only
ever used from Next.js route handlers).

### Key files
`supabase/schema.sql` (run once in Supabase's SQL editor), `src/app/api/donations/route.ts`,
`src/app/api/admin/**`, `src/app/admin/**`, `src/lib/{supabase,email,admin-auth,reminders,donation-row}.ts`,
`src/lib/pdf/donation-pledge.tsx`, `netlify/functions/recurring-reminders.ts`.

## CONTENT EDITOR (CMS) — built 2026-08-15

Staff change the words and photos themselves at `/admin/content`, behind the same password as
`/admin/donations`. **All 19 marketing pages are covered**, grouped in the admin as:

| Group | Entries |
|-------|---------|
| Pages | Homepage, About Us, Our Staff, Our Mission, Programs overview, Get Help, Stories, News, Donate, Contact |
| Programs | One entry per program — Food Closet, Clothing Closet, Children Tuition, Adult Vocation, Family Medical, Resource Materials |
| Shared across pages | Testimonials, Upcoming Events, Footer |

### The one rule
**Every editable field is declared once, in `src/lib/cms/pages/<page>.ts`.** That declaration is
both the default value the site ships with *and* the form the editor sees. There is no second
source of truth to keep in sync — that is the whole point.

### How it fits together
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/lib/cms/types.ts` | The content model and the field-definition types |
| `src/lib/cms/fields.ts` | `text()`, `textarea()`, `strings()`, `image()`, `video()`, `select()`, `icon()`, `list()` |
| `src/lib/cms/pages/*.ts` | Per-page content type + defaults + form layout |
| `src/lib/cms/pages/program.ts` | `makeProgramSchema()` — builds one editor per entry in `PROGRAMS` |
| `src/lib/cms/registry.ts` | `PAGE_SCHEMAS` + `groupedPageSchemas()` — the list the admin shows |
| `src/lib/cms/collections.ts` | `getPrograms()`, `getTestimonials()`, `getUpcomingEvents()`, `getNewsUpdates()` |
| `src/lib/cms/merge.ts` | Pure merge/diff. Runs on the server AND in the browser |
| `src/lib/cms/merge.test.ts` | `npm run test:cms` — 27 checks on the merge. No framework, no deps |
| `src/lib/cms/content.ts` | `getPageContent()` / `savePageContent()` (server-only) |
| `src/lib/cms/media.ts` | Supabase Storage uploads + the picker's asset list |
| `src/lib/cms/media-manifest.ts` | **Generated.** `npm run media:manifest` after adding to `/public` |
| `src/app/admin/content/**` | The editor UI — generated entirely from the schema |
| `src/app/api/admin/content/[page]` | Save + `revalidatePath` |
| `src/app/api/admin/media` | List + upload |

### Adding a page to the CMS
1. Write `src/lib/cms/pages/<page>.ts` — a content type, a `defaults` object holding the copy that
   is in the page today, and `groups` describing the form.
2. Add it to `PAGE_SCHEMAS` in `registry.ts` (wrapped in `widen()`).
3. In the page component: `const content = await getPageContent(<page>Schema)` and replace the
   hardcoded strings with `content.x`. The page becomes `async`.
4. No admin UI changes. The form builds itself.

### Things that will bite you
⚠️ **Only the diff is stored.** `site_content.content` holds just the fields someone has actually
changed. Untouched fields keep reading from code, so a copy fix in `pages/*.ts` still reaches the
live site. The flip side: **renaming a field key orphans any saved override for it** — the merge
drops unknown keys. Migrate deliberately if you rename.

⚠️ **`PageSchema<T>` is invariant in `T`.** `keyof T` types the field keys, which is what makes a
mistyped key a compile error. That is why `registry.ts` needs the `widen()` cast — don't "simplify"
it away without replacing the key checking.

⚠️ **Client components take content as props.** The home components (`HeroSection`, `StatsSection`,
…) and `Header` are `'use client'`, so the server page or layout fetches once and passes `content`
down. Never call `getPageContent` from a client component — it is `server-only`.

⚠️ **One query per render, via `cache()`.** `content.ts` loads the whole `site_content` table once
and memoises it for the render. A page reading its own content plus the footer plus all six
programs still costs a single round trip — so call the helpers freely, but do not add a second
un-cached client.

⚠️ **Contact details are NOT in the CMS.** `ORG` in `constants.ts` stays the single source for the
email address, phone numbers and physical address, because the same values go into donation
receipts, pledge PDFs and reminder emails. Editing them in one place only would leave the site and
the emails disagreeing. One line in `constants.ts` changes all of them at once. Same reasoning for
`SWIFT_DETAILS`, `US_CHECK_DETAILS` and `BANK_FEE_USD` — they must match what the bank says.

⚠️ **A program's `slug`, `fund` and `relatedSlugs` are not editable.** They are routing and
donation-fund keys, not copy; a typo would break a URL or misdirect a gift. `getPrograms()` always
takes them from `PROGRAMS` in `constants.ts` and merges only the copy on top.

⚠️ **Images need `remotePatterns`.** Uploads live on Supabase Storage, so `next.config.ts` allows
`**.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/**`. A self-hosted Supabase host is picked up from
`SUPABASE_URL` at build time.

⚠️ **A cleared image or icon falls back to the default** rather than rendering a broken `<Image>`.
Text fields may legitimately be emptied; images and icons may not.

⚠️ **`STAFF_MEMBERS` and `IMPACT_STATS` are gone from `constants.ts`** — they live in the staff and
home schemas now. Do not re-add them; two copies is the drift problem this replaced.

⚠️ **`PROGRAMS`, `TESTIMONIALS`, `UPCOMING_EVENTS` and `NEWS_UPDATES` are still in `constants.ts`,
but only as the CMS defaults.** Pages must read them through `collections.ts`, never import the
constant directly — importing the constant renders the shipped copy and silently ignores every
edit. `ProgramView` (not `Program`) is the type pages and components take.

### Running the checks
`npm run test:cms` — 27 assertions on the merge/diff, including the save round-trip
(`merge(diff) === edited`). No test framework and no dependencies; it runs on node's built-in type
stripping, which is why `allowImportingTsExtensions` is on in `tsconfig.json`.

### Requirements to actually run
**No new env vars** — the CMS reuses `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
and `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` from the donation backend. Two setup steps:

1. Run the `site_content` block in `supabase/schema.sql` (SQL editor, same project as donations).
2. Create the `site-media` bucket in the **dashboard** — Storage → New bucket → public ON.
   ⚠️ Not in SQL: on a project where Storage has never been opened, `storage.buckets` does not
   exist yet, and because the SQL editor runs a pasted script as one transaction, that failure also
   rolls back the `site_content` table created above it.

**Without any of this the site still renders the copy that ships in code** — the editor loads and
the media picker works off `/public`, but saving reports that the database is not connected.
Without only the bucket, everything works except uploading new photos.

## BRAND COLORS & TYPOGRAPHY

### Brand Colors
- **Forest Green**: `forest-green-50` through `forest-green-900` (primary brand)
- **Amber**: `amber-400` / `amber-500` / `amber-600` (accent only — not section backgrounds)
- **Warm White**: `warm-white` (page backgrounds)
- **Warm Gray**: `warm-gray-400` through `warm-gray-900` (text)

### Typography
- **Serif** (`font-serif`): Merriweather — headings, hero text, stats numbers
- **Sans** (`font-sans`): Inter — body, UI elements

### Animation Pattern
```tsx
<FadeUp delay={0.1}>
  <YourContent />
</FadeUp>
```
Stagger sibling elements with `delay={i * 0.08}`.

### Logo
- File: `/public/HSF_logo.png` (horizontal logo)
- Header: `className="h-12 sm:h-14 md:h-20 w-auto object-contain"`
- Footer: white pill background `rounded-2xl px-5 py-3`, `h-14 w-auto`

### TypeScript Rules
- Strict mode enabled — no `any` types
- Explicit return types on all functions
- Interface over type for objects
- Props interfaces named `ComponentNameProps`

### Component Rules
- Server Components by default
- `'use client'` only for: forms, animations, state, browser APIs
- All client components that use Framer Motion must be in separate files

### Styling Rules
- Tailwind utility classes only
- Mobile-first: `sm:` → `md:` → `lg:` breakpoints
- Hero text sizing: `text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl` (never plain `text-5xl`)
- `next/image` with `fill` always needs `sizes` prop

## HOW TO UPDATE CONTENT (for non-dev updates)

**Almost nothing here needs a developer any more.** Staff edit every page's wording and photos at
`/admin/content` — see "CONTENT EDITOR (CMS)" above.

Still a code change, deliberately:

| Content | Where | Why not in the CMS |
|---------|-------|--------------------|
| Email, phone numbers, address | `ORG` in `constants.ts` | Also used in receipts, PDFs and reminder emails — must not diverge |
| SWIFT bank details | `SWIFT_DETAILS` | Must match the bank and the confirmation emails |
| US check details | `US_CHECK_DETAILS` | Same |
| Bank fee amount | `BANK_FEE_USD` | Feeds the donation total calculation |
| Donation amount buttons | `DONATION_AMOUNTS` | Feeds form validation |
| Program URL / fund keys | `PROGRAMS` → `slug`, `fund`, `relatedSlugs` | Routing and fund routing, not copy |
| Navigation menu structure | `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx` | Site structure, not copy |

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

⚠️ **Bank Fee**: `BANK_FEE_USD = 45` (not $50 as previously stated). Donors actively choose whether to cover it. Never hide this cost.

⚠️ **SWIFT Details**: Not sensitive — meant to be shared for receiving payments. Safe to display publicly.

⚠️ **Recurring Donations**: SWIFT is manual. "Recurring" means the donor sets up recurring transfers at their bank. Email reminders in Phase 2.

⚠️ **As-Needed Framing**: Never describe programs as "long-term" or "ongoing welfare." Always use: "as-needed," "emergency basis," "temporary crisis," "through their crisis period."

⚠️ **Faith-Based Language**: Always acknowledge the faith foundation — "faith-grounded," "spiritual," "faith-based." This is core to the organization's identity.

⚠️ **Mobile First**: 70%+ of Uganda web traffic is mobile. Every component must work on small screens first.

⚠️ **Tailwind v4**: There is NO `tailwind.config.js`. All config is in `globals.css` via `@theme {}`. Do not create a tailwind config file.

⚠️ **Program.image is required**: `src/types/index.ts` — `image: string` (not `image?: string`). All 6 programs have images defined.

⚠️ **Google Maps iframe**: The contact page embeds Google Maps via `<iframe>` (no API key needed). The `MAP_SRC` constant is in `contact/page.tsx`. No CSP changes needed.

## SESSION WORKFLOW

### Starting a New Session
1. Say: **"Read CLAUDE.md first"**
2. Claude reads this file to get full project context
3. No re-explaining needed — all state is here

### To Update Content Only
1. Edit `src/lib/constants.ts` for data changes
2. Edit specific page files for copy changes
3. Run `npm run build` to verify — must show 18 pages, 0 errors

### To Build a New Page
1. Create `src/app/(marketing)/[page-name]/page.tsx`
2. Use `FadeUp` for scroll animations
3. Hero: full-bleed overlay with a real HSF field photo (see photo map above)
4. Follow section heading pattern: amber rule + label + serif heading
5. Alternate `bg-warm-white` / `bg-white` / `bg-forest-green-50` / `bg-forest-green-900`
6. Run `npm run build` to verify

**Last Updated**: 2026-08-15
**Version**: 3.3
**Status**: Phase 1 — Feature Complete (19 pages), real donation backend built (Supabase + Resend
+ PDF invoicing + admin view + recurring reminders). Content editor covers all 19 pages plus
programs, testimonials, events and the footer. dfcu SWIFT/BIC code and US check mailing address
are confirmed. Awaiting real impact stats and Supabase/Resend account provisioning from client.
**Next Step**: Provision Supabase/Resend accounts + env vars (unblocks both the donation backend
AND the content editor) → get real impact stats from client → visual QA of the editor on a phone →
go live on Netlify
