# PROGRESS — Healthy Steps Foundation Website

Running log of what has shipped, what is blocked, and what is next.
`CLAUDE.md` is the project brief (architecture, design rules, conventions); this file is the
timeline. When they disagree, trust this file for *status* and `CLAUDE.md` for *how things work*.

**Last updated**: 2026-09-03
**Phase**: 1 — feature complete, pre-launch
**Deployed to**: Netlify, from `main`

---

## Launch readiness at a glance

| # | Blocker | Owner | Status |
|---|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Real impact statistics | Client | ⛔ Outstanding — placeholder numbers still live. Editable in the CMS (Homepage → Impact numbers), so this no longer needs a developer |
| 2 | Supabase `site_content` table + `site-media` bucket | User | ✅ **Working** — confirmed indirectly on 2026-08-29: the live homepage renders a CMS-saved image served from Supabase Storage (that is what tripped Netlify's secrets scan). Saves and uploads are real |
| 3 | Resend account and env vars | Client / user | ⛔ Outstanding — donation *emails* only; the CMS does not need it |
| 4 | Verify the Netlify deploy is green | User | 🟡 The 2026-08-29 deploy failed on secrets scanning (see timeline); the fix shipped in `a162bd9`, and 22 more commits have landed since (through `e4b79c5`). Confirm the latest deploy went green |
| 5 | Final cross-device smoke test | User | ⚠️ Not started |
| 6 | Update the saved "Watch Videos" heading in the editor | User / client | ⚠️ One manual edit: `/admin/content` → Homepage → Video → Heading → "Videos and Pictures". The saved override shadows the new code default |
| 7 | Sync `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` with the trimmed site | Developer | ⚠️ Both still describe the pre-September homepage, program pages, footer and Food Closet name |

Everything else needed for launch is built.

### Next steps, in order

1. **Confirm the latest Netlify deploy is green** — the secrets-scan fix, the August feedback
   round and the September trim (`dba94b9`..`e4b79c5`) are all unverified in production.
2. **Change the saved video-section heading** to "Videos and Pictures" in `/admin/content`.
3. **Visual QA on a phone** — the four-section homepage, the enlarged header, the video+gallery
   grid and lightbox, the two-column footer, and the new heading hierarchy on inner pages.
4. Get the real impact statistics and a clothing-market photograph from the client; both are
   theirs to enter in the editor, not a developer task.
5. Bring `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` in line with the site as it now is.

## Timeline

### 2026-09-02 → 2026-09-03 — Second feedback round: strip the site down (`2e35dea`..`e4b79c5`, 8 commits)

A live session with the client's owner, one instruction at a time. The theme this round: less
repetition, bigger section titles, and nothing on a page that the navbar already offers.

**Section headings, site-wide.** Every section now follows the pattern the client set for
"Our Impact" in August: the former small uppercase label is the large serif heading, and the old
heading sits under it as a regular-weight serif subtitle. Done first on the homepage
("What We Do", "Stories of Hope", "Our Community", "Partner With Us"), then across all inner
pages in one pass (24 sections on About, Staff, Mission, Programs, program pages, Contact,
Get Help, Stories and News). Page heroes were left as they were. CMS keys are unchanged, so
saved text keeps applying; only the editor labels changed ("Heading" / "Text under the heading").

**Homepage trimmed to four sections.** Events banner → hero → Our Impact → Videos and Pictures.
Removed, at the client's request, because programs and stories have their own pages: the
"What We Do" program grid, "Stories of Hope" testimonials, the "Our Community" photo band and
the "Partner With Us" closing card. `ProgramsSection.tsx` and `TestimonialsSection.tsx` are
deleted; their editor fields are gone from the Homepage schema.

**Header.** Tried a flat nav with every page as a top-level link (`32f269e`), reverted the same
day (`4eab7b1`) — the client wants Our Staff and Our Mission kept under an About dropdown. The
header is exactly as it was before this round.

**Get Help → About Us.** "Who We Serve" (families in temporary crisis + eligibility checklist)
and the four-step process (now labelled "How We Serve") moved to About Us, between Where We
Work and Our Core Values. Their editor fields moved with them.

**Program pages.** The Program Impact figures and the How It Works steps are removed from all
six pages — from the page, `constants.ts`, the types, the program editor schema and the
collection mapping. A program page is now: hero, About This Program + Who We Serve box, photo,
fund-specific donate strip. **Food Closet is renamed Food Pantry** everywhere it is displayed
(menus, cards, footer, fund list, testimonial tag, copy, README). The URL slug and donation
fund key stay `food-closet` so existing links and recorded pledges keep working.

**Duplicate links and CTAs removed** ("anything duplicate of what's in the navbar"):
- Footer: the Programs and Explore columns, the donate button and the "Send us a message"
  link. The footer is now the brand block and the "Reach Us" contact column — the client asked
  for the contacts to stay.
- Mobile drawer: the phone/email lines (the footer has them on every page).
- Events banner: the "Support This Outreach" link (the hero's Donate Now is directly beneath).
- Closing CTA sections on About, Staff, Mission, Programs and Stories.
- Program pages: the All Programs button and the Related Programs grid.
- Get Help: the Send a Message button, the six program cards and the donate prompt. The
  phone/email block stays.
- Stories: the Explore All Programs button (the program-name chips stay; they are not links).
- News: the Donate Now button inside the Give Online card.
- Contact: the two quick-link cards (Get Help, Donate).
Kept deliberately: the homepage hero's Donate Now (the client asked for it in August) and the
fund-specific "Donate to This Program" on program pages.

⚠️ **Orphaned overrides.** Every removed section also removed its editor fields, so any text
staff had saved for them (homepage programs/testimonials/community/CTA, all five closing CTAs,
Get Help programs + message button, program impact/steps, footer column headings, contact
quick links) is no longer read. Nothing user-visible is lost because the elements are gone.

Verified: production build green (26 routes), TypeScript clean, lint clean, `npm run test:cms`
green, and headless-Chrome screenshots of the header at 1280px, About and Get Help. The Chrome
extension was not connected, so no interactive/phone check yet.

### 2026-08-29 → 2026-08-31 — Client feedback round: heroes, header, homepage sections (`dba94b9`..`5ebb70e`, 14 commits)

A live review session with the client's corrections, applied one at a time. The theme: strip
decoration, put the brand in the header, and let real content lead.

**Heroes (homepage + donate).** The white logo cards are gone from both heroes — the page led with
the brand twice (header + hero) and no message. Visible headlines are back: "Every Family Deserves
to Be Whole" (home) and "Donate to Healthy Steps Foundation" (donate), both editable. The CMS
field `heroScreenReaderText` was renamed to `heroHeadline` on both pages since the text is visible
again. The homepage hero also lost its location pill, its "Our Programs" button, and the
"How we serve" label + shield icon above the trust tags — it now reads headline → lead →
Donate Now → tags.

**Header.** In exchange, the header logo grew twice (now `h-20/h-24/h-28` at rest, with the
`next/image` request bumped to 440×126 so it stays sharp) and the bar got taller (`py-4`); the
scrolled state compresses proportionally. Desktop nav links went from 15px to 17px.

**Stats section.** Hierarchy swap: "Our Impact" (previously the small eyebrow) is now the big
serif heading; the former heading text sits under it, same serif, regular weight, one step
smaller. The floating white caption card on the photo (and the sparkle icon inside it) is gone —
the photo stands alone. CMS keys unchanged, only editor labels; saved text keeps applying.

**Video section became "Videos and Pictures".** Same eyebrow/heading swap. The standalone
gallery section further down the homepage was merged in: `GallerySection.tsx` is deleted and the
photo mosaic now lives directly with the video, on the dark background, reusing the same
`galleryPhotos` CMS list. Through three rounds of feedback the video shrank from full-width
standalone → 2×2 tile in the mosaic → a single cell the same size as every photo. All tiles are
equal-sized now (the bento large/wide spans and the editor's "Tile size" select are removed), and
tapping any photo opens a lightbox at natural size (close: backdrop, X, or Escape).

**SectionHeading** gained optional `eyebrow` (can be omitted) and `eyebrowClassName`/
`titleClassName` overrides, which is how the two sections diverge without forking the pattern.

⚠️ **Renames orphaned three saved overrides by design** (`heroScreenReaderText`,
`heroLocation`, `heroProgramsLabel/Href`, `heroTrustLabel`, gallery heading fields) — all fields
whose on-page element was removed, so nothing user-visible was lost. The one that matters:
**the video-section heading override saved as "Watch Videos" still shadows the new
"Videos and Pictures" default** and must be re-saved in the editor (blocker 6 above).

### 2026-08-29 — Netlify deploy failed on secrets scanning; Supabase confirmed live (`a162bd9`)

The production deploy compiled cleanly but died in Netlify's **secrets scanner**: the value of
`SUPABASE_URL` was found in the rendered homepage HTML. Cause: someone has saved content in the
editor with an uploaded photo — Supabase Storage URLs embed the project URL. That URL is public
by design (it ships in every Supabase client app); the fix was
`SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS = "SUPABASE_URL"` in `netlify.toml`. The service-role key and admin
secrets remain scanned.

**Silver lining, and it's big:** this failure is proof that the Supabase table, the storage
bucket, env vars in Netlify, a real CMS save, *and* a real photo upload all work in production —
the exact chain that had never been exercised. Blocker 2 is closed by evidence.

### 2026-08-17 — Supabase setup for the content editor: one trap found

Pasting `supabase/schema.sql` whole into the Supabase SQL editor failed with:

```
ERROR: 42P01: relation "storage.buckets" does not exist
```

**Cause.** The file ended with an `insert into storage.buckets (...)` to create the media bucket.
On a project where the Storage page has never been opened, that schema does not exist yet.
Opening Storage in the dashboard is what provisions it.

**Why it mattered more than it looks.** The Supabase SQL editor runs a pasted script as a single
transaction, so that one failing statement at the bottom **rolled back the `site_content` table
created at the top**. The run looked like it had done nothing at all, which is exactly what it had
done.

**Fix.** The `insert` is removed from `schema.sql` and replaced with a comment explaining why it
must not come back, and how to create the bucket instead: Storage → New bucket → `site-media` →
Public ON. `CLAUDE.md` carries the same warning.

The correct order is now: run the SQL (creates the table), then create the bucket in the dashboard.
Without the bucket, everything works except uploading *new* photos — the editor still runs and the
picker still offers every image that ships in `/public`.

⚠️ Still unconfirmed at the time of writing: whether the re-run succeeded. Nothing downstream of a
real save has been exercised.

### 2026-08-15 — Real photographs replace the stock program images (`872877f`)

The client supplied five real photographs and asked for the stock imagery to go, particularly
anywhere a stock photo of children was standing in for the children they actually serve.

| Program | Now shows | Was |
|---|---|---|
| Food Closet | Staff handing a food bag through the distribution window | Stock |
| Clothing Closet | Mother carrying an HSF bag home with her child | Stock |
| Children Tuition | Boy holding up a new school backpack | Stock |
| Adult Vocation | *unchanged* — tailor at a sewing machine | Unsplash, kept on request |
| Family Medical | Medical partners screening two women at an outreach | Stock |
| Resource Materials | Staff crouching with children, one carrying a box of supplies | Unsplash |

- The five stock files are **deleted**, not just unreferenced, so they can no longer be picked by
  mistake in the content editor.
- Adult Vocation was left alone as instructed — it shows a sewing machine and no faces, so it
  illustrates the trade rather than standing in for a real person.
- Each program now carries `imageAlt` describing what is actually in the photo. Previously the alt
  text was the program name repeated, which told a screen-reader user nothing.
- A sixth supplied photo (a second frame of the medical screening) went into the field library as
  `field/medical-screening-wide.jpg`, available in the editor's picker.

⚠️ **The client gave no clothing photograph.** Clothing Closet is using a real HSF photo of a
family carrying an HSF bag home — honest, but not literally the clothing market. Worth asking for
one; swapping it is a 30-second job in the editor now, no developer needed.

⚠️ **Two photos came through WhatsApp and are portrait and recompressed**
(902×1280 and 810×1080). They crop to the middle band in the 16:10 cards and will look soft on a
large desktop hero — most traffic is mobile, where they are fine. The un-compressed originals off
the client's phone would be a straight improvement, and a drop-in replacement.

### 2026-08-15 — Content editor, pass 2: everything else (`4d9abc9`)

The remaining 16 pages are converted. **Every page on the site is now editable** at
`/admin/content`, grouped as Pages (10), Programs (6, one screen each) and Shared across pages
(Testimonials, Upcoming Events, Footer).

- **Programs** get one editor each rather than six rows in a list — their steps and impact figures
  are lists of their own, and nesting two levels deep produces a form nobody can use. Built by a
  factory from `PROGRAMS`, so all six stay identical in shape.
- **Testimonials, events and news posts** are add/edit/delete/reorder lists. Adding a news post now
  actually shows: the newest is the featured letter, and any others appear as an "Earlier updates"
  list that simply is not rendered while there is only one.
- **One database round trip per page render.** `content.ts` loads the whole table once through
  React's `cache()`, so a page reading its own copy plus the footer plus all six programs still
  costs a single query.
- **Fixed a real bug**: each program's description holds several paragraphs separated by blank
  lines, but the detail page rendered it inside one `<p>`, so it displayed as a single run-on
  block. It is now a proper paragraph list. Program photos also carry their own alt text instead
  of repeating the program name.
- Deliberately **not** in the CMS: contact details, bank details and the bank fee (they also go
  into receipts, PDFs and reminder emails — a half-edited value would leave the site and the emails
  disagreeing), and each program's URL/fund keys (routing, not copy). `CLAUDE.md` lists these.

Verified: production build green (26 routes), TypeScript clean, lint unchanged from before this
work. All 12 marketing pages fetched and spot-checked for content — 22 distinctive strings from
every converted section, all present. All 15 editor screens load with their accordion sections
intact. **`npm run test:cms` — 27 new assertions** on the merge/diff logic, including the save
round-trip, junk-input fallback and list reorder/delete. Still untested: a real save, which needs
Supabase.

### 2026-08-15 — Content editor, pass 1 (`4d9abc9`)

Staff can now change words and photos themselves at `/admin/content`, behind the existing admin
password. Homepage, About Us and Our Staff converted first, to check the editing experience before
rolling it across the rest. *(Both passes landed in the single commit `4d9abc9` — they are split
here because they were built and reviewed as two steps, not because there are two commits.)*

- **Every field is declared once**, in `src/lib/cms/pages/*.ts` — the same declaration is both the
  copy the site ships with and the form the editor sees. Architecture detail is in `CLAUDE.md` →
  "CONTENT EDITOR (CMS)". Adding a page needs no admin UI work; the form builds itself.
- **Only the diff is stored.** `site_content` holds just the fields someone actually changed, so a
  later copy fix in code still reaches every untouched field, and "Reset to original" is a delete
  rather than a second source of truth.
- **Photos**: upload to Supabase Storage, or pick from the 66 images already in `/public`
  (`npm run media:manifest` regenerates that list). Alt text is stored next to each image so the
  two cannot drift apart.
- Editable per page: headings, eyebrow labels, body paragraphs, button labels *and* links, images
  with alt text, icons, and repeatable lists — team members, core values, impact numbers, gallery
  tiles — with add / delete / reorder.
- `STAFF_MEMBERS` and `IMPACT_STATS` were **removed** from `constants.ts`. They live in the staff
  and home schemas now; keeping a second copy is exactly the drift this was built to stop.
- Saving calls `revalidatePath`, so edits appear on the live site without a rebuild.
- ⚠️ Renaming a field key orphans any saved override for it — the merge drops unknown keys.

Verified at the time: production build green (29 routes — pass 2 later reduced this to 26 by
dropping a needless `generateStaticParams`), TypeScript clean, no new lint findings. Login,
auth rejection, both editor screens, the 66-asset media API, and the save + unknown-page error
paths were all exercised over HTTP. **The one path that could not be tested is a real save**, which
needs Supabase.

### 2026-08-03 — Homepage logo + honest donate copy (`67894ff`)
- Homepage hero headline "Every Family Deserves to Be Whole" replaced by the **HSF logo**,
  matching the donate page. The line survives as screen-reader text inside the `<h1>`, so the
  page keeps one top-level heading and search engines still index the phrase.
- Donate copy said US donors could give "by check or online", which reads as a card checkout.
  **There is no card checkout.** Copy is now "by check or by SWIFT bank transfer", and the method
  picker reads "US Donors — Give by Check".
- ⚠️ Both heroes now lead with a logo rather than a sentence. A logo does not tell a first-time
  visitor why they should care. If it reads flat in review, add a short line under the logo
  rather than reverting.

### 2026-07-30 — Client content corrections (`9ab1dfc`)
Applied the client's marked-up corrections:
- **Donate**: logo replaces the hero headline; "Two Ways to Give" + "Safe & Transparent" cards
  collapse into one **Secure Giving** card; `$500` now reads "Covers Family Medical and counseling
  support for a full year"; bank-fee wording corrected; donation summary gained a
  **"Total received is"** line (a $50 gift not covering the fee shows −$45 → $5, clamped at zero);
  check giving trimmed to "Mail it to First Baptist Sweetwater" plus the payable-to / memo /
  address rows.
- **Staff**: hero is now "Meet Our Team" with the client's wording.
- **About**: hero is now "About Us", body opens "We are a faith-based organization partnering…".
- "as-needed basis" → **"temporary basis"** in the footer, Family Medical description and
  Programs menu.
- **Donation pop-up removed** from every page. `DonationPopup.tsx` is still in
  `src/components/donation/` if it is ever wanted back.
- Vision and Our Story already matched the client's text — left untouched.
- Kept the check pledge-confirmation form despite "delete the rest": removing it would break the
  backend that records pledges and emails the PDF.

### 2026-07-30 — Premium UI pass (`2e13713`)
Full visual/interaction overhaul. Detail lives in `CLAUDE.md` → "UI SYSTEM"; the highlights:
- **Fonts were never loading.** `--font-sans`/`--font-serif` named `'Inter'`/`'Merriweather'`
  literally, but `next/font` emits hashed family names. Every page fell back to system fonts.
- **17 nested `<Link><Button>` pairs** across 8 pages produced `<a>` wrapping `<button>` — invalid
  HTML that double-announces to screen readers. Replaced with `ButtonLink` / `buttonStyles()`.
- **Mobile drawer was inside `<header>`**, whose `backdrop-filter` makes it a containing block for
  `position: fixed` — the drawer would have been clipped to header height once scrolled.
- Header rebuilt: frosted glass on scroll, reading-progress bar, Programs mega-menu, active-route
  underlines, animated drawer. The old dropdowns were CSS `group-hover` only and unreachable by
  keyboard.
- Design tokens (warm-ink elevation scale, shared easing), `SectionHeading`, redesigned program /
  staff / testimonial cards, hero parallax and grain.
- Accessibility: skip link, global focus ring, `prefers-reduced-motion`, dark-on-amber CTAs
  (white on amber-500 failed contrast).

### 2026-07-30 — Real testimonials (`447a232`)
- Removed three **invented** placeholder testimonials (Grace N., John K., Sarah M.).
- Added two real ones from the Makerere Kikoni outreach: **Charles Kasibante** (medical partner)
  and **Patricia Kayeny** (beneficiary). Quotes verbatim apart from dropping spoken
  self-introductions and one typo fix.
- Both grids were built for three cards; they now adapt to two and return to three automatically
  when a third story is added.
- ❗ Never re-add fabricated testimonials.

### 2026-07-17 and earlier
- Operational content extracted from the client's Operational Manual and Programs docs (`b192a2b`).
- Stakeholder-meeting decisions applied (`868c6d3`).
- dfcu SWIFT/BIC (`DFCUUGKA`) and the US check address (3800 Wekiva Rd., Longwood, FL 32779)
  filled in; News page added (`b23dec1`).
- Donation backend built (`6f43e9b`): Supabase pledges, PDF pledge confirmations via Resend,
  `/admin/donations`, recurring reminders as a Netlify scheduled function.
- 19 pages, design system, and all real photography shipped before that.

## Known risks

**~~The last three pushes have no completed local production build behind them.~~ RESOLVED
2026-08-15.** `next build` now completes cleanly (29 routes) after a fresh `npm install` — the
`next/font/google` woff2 fetches from `fonts.gstatic.com` succeeded this time. The failure was
environmental, not in the source. ESLint still has the one pre-existing error
(`CurrencyConverter.tsx:118`).
*If it recurs: self-host the two fonts via `next/font/local` and drop the build-time network
dependency.*

**`node_modules` keeps emptying itself.** It was corrupted twice in one session (truncated
`next/package.json` and `@edge-runtime/primitives`, stray `routes.d 2.ts` files in `.next`), and on
2026-08-15 it was found completely empty. That is a file-sync tool (iCloud/Dropbox) writing into
the project directory. Reinstalling fixes it, and it will keep recurring until the folder is
excluded from sync.

**No interactive or phone QA has been done on the UI pass, the content editor, or either
feedback round.** Everything has been verified by local production builds plus a few headless
desktop screenshots (2026-09-03: header at 1280px, About, Get Help). Highest-value checks now:
the four-section homepage on a phone, the video+photo grid and its lightbox, the caption
legibility inside the small video tile, the two-column footer on narrow screens, and the new
heading/subtitle hierarchy on inner pages.

~~**A real save has never run.**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-08-29** — the Netlify secrets-scan failure
proved a saved CMS edit with an uploaded Supabase Storage photo is rendering on the live
homepage. Save, upload, and `next/image` remote loading all work in production.

**Twenty-two commits are on `main` and unverified in production** (`dba94b9`..`e4b79c5`), including
the secrets-scan fix itself, four deleted components, and several CMS schema changes. All build
clean locally (26 routes, CMS tests green). Confirm the latest Netlify deploy before assuming the
site is fine.

**Saved CMS overrides can shadow code changes.** Now that real saves exist, editing a default in
`src/lib/cms/pages/*.ts` only shows where staff have not saved that field — the "Watch Videos"
heading is the live example. When a copy change does not appear, check `/admin/content` before
suspecting the deploy.

**`CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` are behind the site.** `CLAUDE.md` still describes the hero logo,
a six-section homepage with programs and testimonials, program pages with impact figures and
steps, a four-column footer, the `ProgramStep`/`ProgramImpactStat` types and the "Food Closet"
name. `README.md` was updated for the rename only. Trust this file for status; sync both when
the dust settles on the client's feedback (blocker 7).

**The site is now very lean, by instruction.** The homepage has no programs, no stories and no
closing call to action; inner pages have no cross-links except the navbar and the footer's
contact column. That is what the client asked for, twice over. If engagement or SEO suffers
after launch, the first things to consider re-adding are a program grid on the homepage and
Related Programs on program pages — both were removed in `e436812` / `e4b79c5` and are easy to
restore from history.

---

## Open questions for the client

1. **A photograph of the clothing market** — nothing in the supplied set or the existing library
   shows it, so Clothing Closet is using a related HSF photo instead.
2. **Un-compressed originals** of the food-closet and children-tuition photos, straight off the
   phone rather than through WhatsApp.
3. **Patricia Kayeny's location** — her testimonial does not say where she lives. Currently labelled
   "Makerere Kikoni Outreach" because the support she describes matches that event; needs confirming.
4. **Impact statistics** — the homepage impact numbers still hold invented values (1200+ families, 500+
   children, 3+ years). These are public-facing claims about a charity and should not go live
   unverified.
5. **Food Pantry URL** — the name changed but the address is still `/programs/food-closet`. Do
   they want `/programs/food-pantry` too? That needs a redirect and a new fund key, so it is a
   deliberate change rather than a rename.
6. **"How We Serve"** — Get Help had no section by that name, so the four-step "How It Works"
   process was the one moved to About Us. Confirm that is the section they meant.

---

## Phase 2 (post-launch)

Analytics, SEO metadata and OG images, dark mode, and a fuller Stories experience. `Get Help` and
`Stories` are no longer placeholders — both shipped — so the original Phase 2 list in `CLAUDE.md`
overstates what is left.

~~**Content editor, pass 2**~~ — done 2026-08-15.
