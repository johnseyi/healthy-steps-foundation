# Healthy Steps Foundation

Website for **Healthy Steps Foundation**, a faith-based nonprofit in Wakiso, Uganda, that partners with families to improve mental health wellness through community programs.

**Live:** https://healthy-steps-foundation.vercel.app *(deployment currently paused pending Vercel account review)*

The organization empowers families in Uganda through mental health support, education, and essential resources — delivered through a holistic, faith-guided, and dignity-first approach. The site presents the foundation's programs (Food Pantry, Clothing Closet, Children's Tuition Support, Adult Vocational Training, Family Medical Assistance, Resource Materials) and carries a full donation pledge flow plus a small admin backend.

## Features

- Marketing pages: home, mission, about, programs (with per-program detail pages), staff, stories, news, get-help, contact, donate
- **Donation pledge flow** — validated with react-hook-form + zod, recorded in Supabase, with a pledge PDF generated server-side and emailed to the donor via Resend
- **Recurring-donation reminders** — a scheduled Netlify function (plus an admin-triggerable API route) that emails reminders for recurring pledges
- **Admin area** (`/admin`) — cookie-authenticated login, a donations dashboard, and a content editor
- **Lightweight CMS** — page content defaults are declared in code and overlaid with edits stored in a Supabase `site_content` table; if Supabase is unconfigured or unreachable, pages fall back to the in-code defaults instead of failing
- "Add to calendar" (`.ics`) downloads for upcoming events
- Framer Motion animations throughout

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + React
- Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/postcss`, forms + typography plugins)
- Supabase (Postgres + Storage) — schema in `supabase/schema.sql`
- Resend (transactional email), `@react-pdf/renderer` (server-side PDFs)
- react-hook-form + zod, Framer Motion
- Deployed on Vercel; Netlify config included (`netlify.toml` + `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`)

## Implementation notes

- **Server-rendered PDF receipts:** `src/lib/pdf/donation-pledge.tsx` builds the donation pledge document with `@react-pdf/renderer` and `renderToBuffer`, so the PDF is composed as React components and attached to the confirmation email — no client-side PDF work.
- **PL/pgSQL invoice numbering:** invoice numbers on the `donations` table are assigned by a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger function in `supabase/schema.sql` (a generated column can't reference the sequence-backed id, a trigger can).
- **Portable reminders module:** `src/lib/reminders.ts` is deliberately framework-agnostic (no `server-only`, no path aliases) so the same code is bundled both by Next.js for the admin API route and by Netlify's function bundler for the scheduled function.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

The site runs without any backend configured (CMS content falls back to in-code defaults). For the full donation/admin flows, provide Supabase (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`), Resend, and admin credentials via environment variables, and apply `supabase/schema.sql` to your Supabase project.

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run media:manifest   # regenerate the media manifest
npm run test:cms         # run the CMS merge tests
```
